# vscursor
This is a visual studio code extension which aims to port some functionalities of [Cursor](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/) to visual studio code. Think of it as a less cool, but free [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

## 🚀 Features
 - Generate code

### TODO
 - Edit selected code
 - Chat

## ⚙️ Settings
None yet, this project is in a really early stage - but there are definitly some to come.

## 👨‍💻 Development
Clone this repository and install the project dependencies with your favourite package manager
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gthvmt/vscursor.git
cd vscursor
npm i
```
Then, to run/debug this extension open it in vscode and press `F5`

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Just a heads up, the API calls used in this extension send the entire content of the file you use a command on to the Cursor API. Maybe dont use this with files in which you have paste your credit card info. (I will probably add a setting soon which disables this 'feature')
